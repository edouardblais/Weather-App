#The Condis Channel

"The Condis Channel" is a web app to obtain weather information for the city of your choice!

Simply enter your desired location in the search bar to get the current weather as well as the forecast for the next 5 days.

Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API as the data source, this app is built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
It also makes use of webpack for module bundling and the date-fns library for date manipulation. 

The learning goal here was to familiarize myself with APIs and promises. 

Enjoy!
